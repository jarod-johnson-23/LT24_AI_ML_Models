 Hi, Shirley. This is Chris.

[Speaker 0] (10.0s - 11.0s):
 Hi Chris.

[Speaker 1] (11.0s - 14.0s):

[Speaker 0 & Speaker 1] (14.0s - 17.0s):

[Speaker 0] (19.0s - 30.0s):
 Yeah, well, I see my microphone here, but I had trouble with this one other time is that I had to go on my other computer to get to get the microphone to work.
 So I'm not sure what it is.

[Speaker 1] (30.0s - 39.0s):
 This is fine. I just we we just love to have a transcript so that when we go through it, we can kind of consider everything that we're hearing from everybody. So I appreciate your flexibility.

[Speaker 0] (39.0s - 42.0s):
 Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (42.0s - 70.0s):
